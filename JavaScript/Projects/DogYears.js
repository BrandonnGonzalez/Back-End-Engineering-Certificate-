/*
Dogs mature at a faster rate than human beings. We often say a dog’s age can be calculated in “dog years” to account for their growth compared to a human of the same age. In some ways we could say, time moves quickly for dogs — 8 years in a 
human’s life equates to 45 years in a dog’s life. 
How old would you be if you were a dog?
