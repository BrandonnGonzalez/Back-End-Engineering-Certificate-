--My first day as a TechCrunch Reporter, I was tasked with writing an article on the rising trends in the startup world.
--To get started with my research, my boss sent out a project.sqlite file that contains a table called 'startup'. It is a portfolio of some of the biggest names in the industry.
--To complete this task, I wrote queries with aggregate functions to retrieve some interesting insights about these companies.



-- Step 2: Calculates the total number of companies in the table
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM startups;

-- Step 3: Calculates the total value of all companies in the table
SELECT SUM(valuation) FROM startups;

-- Step 4 and 5: Maximum amount of money raised by a startup, then return the max amount of money raised during 'Seed' stage.
SELECT MAX(raised) FROM startups WHERE stage = 'Seed';

-- Step 6: What year was the oldest company on the list founded?
SELECT MIN(founded) FROM startups;

-- Step 7: Returns the average valuation
SELECT AVG(valuation) FROM startups;

-- Step 8: Returns the average valuation from each category
SELECT category, AVG(valuation) 
FROM startups 
GROUP BY category;

-- Step 9, 10: Returns the average valuation in each category. Then rounds the averages of each cateogry to two decimal places, and orders the list from highest averages to lowest.
SELECT category, ROUND(AVG(valuation), 2)
FROM startups
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;


-- Step 11 and 12: returns the name of each category with the total number of companies that belong to it. Then filters the result to only include categories that have more than three companies in them, which resukts to 3 companies.
SELECT category, COUNT(*) FROM startups GROUP BY category HAVING COUNT(*) > 3;

-- Step 13: Calculates the average size of a startup in each location
SELECT location, AVG(employees) FROM startups GROUP BY location HAVING AVG(employees) > 500;
