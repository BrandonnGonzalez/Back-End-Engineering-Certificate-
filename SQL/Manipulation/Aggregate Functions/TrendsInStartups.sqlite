--My first day as a TechCrunch Reporter, I was tasked with writing an article on the rising trends in the startup world.
--To get started with my research, my boss sent out a project.sqlite file that contains a table called 'startup'. It is a portfolio of some of the biggest names in the industry.
--To complete this task, I wrote queries with aggregate functions to retrieve some interesting insights about these companies!



-- Step 1: There are 10 columns
SELECT *
FROM startups;


-- Step 2: Calculate the total number of companies in the table
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM startups;

-- Step 3: Calculate the total values of all the companies in table
SELECT SUM(valuation) FROM startups;
-- total values of all companies = 974455790000

-- Step 4 & 5: Calculates highest amount raised by startup
SELECT MAX(raised) FROM startups 
WHERE stage = 'Seed';
-- highest amount raised = 11500000000
-- highest amount raised with condition = 1800000

-- Step 6: What yearw as the oldest company founded?
SELECT MIN(founded) FROM startups;
-- returns 1994

-- Step 7: Return the average valuation
SELECT AVG(valuation) FROM startups;
-- AVG(valuation) == 15974685081.9672

-- Step 8: Return avg valuation in each category
SELECT category, AVG(valuation) FROM startups GROUP BY category;

-- Step 9: Return avg(valuation) in each category, while rounding the avg to two decimal places.
SELECT category, ROUND(AVG(valuation), 2) FROM startups GROUP BY category;

-- Step 10: Return AVG(valuation) in each category, rounding the AVG to two decimal places, ordering the list from highest averages to lowest.
SELECT category, ROUND(AVG(valuation), 2) 
FROM startups
GROUP BY 1 -- groups by category
ORDER BY 2 DESC; -- orders by ROUND(AVG(valuation), 2)


-- Step 11: Returns the name of each category with the total number of companies that belong to it
SELECT category, COUNT(*) FROM startups
GROUP BY category;

-- Step 12: Filters the result to only include categories that have more than three companies in them.
SELECT category FROM startups
GROUP BY category
HAVING COUNT(*) > 3;
-- The most competitive markets are: Education, Mobile, Social.

-- Step 13: Average size of a startup in each location
SELECT location, AVG(employees) FROM startups
GROUP BY location;


-- Step 14: Average size of a startup in each location, with average sizes above 500
SELECT location, AVG(employees) FROM startups
GROUP BY 1
HAVING AVG(employees) > 500;
-- returns: Brooklyn - 502.666
-- New York: 702.75
-- San Fran: 1920.4
-- Silicon valley: 1804.6
