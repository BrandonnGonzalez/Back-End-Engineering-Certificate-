 --SELECT * FROM transactions;

-- step 2: Grabs the sum of all of the money in the table
--SELECT SUM(money_in) FROM transactions;

-- step 3: Grabs the sum of all of the money out the table
--SELECT SUM(money_out) FROM transactions;

-- step 4: Check to see the difference in between the regular money_in, compared to the money that was coming in from bitcoin
/*
SELECT COUNT(money_in) AS 'Default money_in'
FROM transactions;
SELECT COUNT(money_in) as 'Bitcoin money_in' 
FROM transactions
WHERE currency = 'BIT';
*/


-- step 5: Find the largest transaction in the whole table, which is money_out with the value of $15,047
--SELECT MAX(money_in), MAX(money_out) FROM transactions;

-- step 6: Finds the average(money_in) from the table where the currency is 'ETH'
/*
SELECT AVG(money_in) 
FROM transactions 
WHERE currency = 'ETH';
*/
-- step 7 and 8: Select the date, average money_in, average money_out, from the table and group it all by date. Also round the averages to 2 decimal places and rename the selected columns
select date AS 'Date', 
ROUND(AVG(money_in), 2) AS 'Rounded Money-In', 
ROUND(AVG(money_out), 2) AS 'Rounded Money-Out'
FROM transactions
GROUP BY 1;
