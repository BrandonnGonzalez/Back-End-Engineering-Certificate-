/*
Hacker News is a popular website run by Y Combinator. Itâ€™s widely known by people in the tech industry as a community site for sharing news, showing off projects, asking questions, among other things.

In this project, you will be working with a table named hacker_news that contains stories from Hacker News since its launch in 2007. It has the following columns:

title: the title of the story
user: the user who submitted the story
score: the score of the story
timestamp: the time of the story
url: the link of the story

 -- step 1: Finding the most popular Hacker News stories
 SELECT title, score
FROM hacker_news
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- step 2: Find the  total score of all the stories.
SELECT SUM(score) FROM hacker_news;

-- step 3:  Finds the individual users who have gotten combined scores of more than 200, and their combined scores summed up.
SELECT user, SUM(score) 
FROM hacker_news 
GROUP BY user
HAVING SUM(score) > 200
ORDER BY 2 DESC;


-- Step 4: Add the top user's scores together and divide it by the total sum:

SELECT (517 + 309 + 304 + 282) / 6366.0;
-- The 4 users have a combined total of 22% in scores.

-- Step 5: How many times has each offending user posted this link?
SELECT user,
   COUNT(*)
FROM hacker_news
WHERE url LIKE '%watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ%'
GROUP BY user
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;

-- Step 6 and 7: 
-- Which sites feed Hacker News?

SELECT CASE
   WHEN url LIKE '%github.com%' THEN 'GitHub'
   WHEN url LIKE '%medium.com%' THEN 'Medium'
   WHEN url LIKE '%nytimes.com%' THEN 'New York Times'
   ELSE 'Other'
  END AS 'Source',
  COUNT(*)
FROM hacker_news
GROUP BY 1;


-- Step 8: Shows the top 10 most recent timestamps from posts
SELECT timestamp
FROM hacker_news
LIMIT 10;


-- Step 9: Using strftime() function to return formatted dates
SELECT timestamp,
   strftime('%H', timestamp) -- %H Returns the hour of the column
FROM hacker_news
GROUP BY 1
LIMIT 20;

-- Step 10: Returns the three columns: The hours of the timestamp, the average score for each hour, and the count of stories for each hour.
-- What's the best time to post a story?
-- AND 
-- Step 11: Rounds the average scores, renames the columns to make it more readable using AS, and adds a WHERE clause to filter out the NULL values in the timestamp.

SELECT strftime('%H', timestamp) AS 'Hour', 
   ROUND(AVG(score), 1) AS 'Average Score', 
   COUNT(*) AS 'Number of Stories'
FROM hacker_news
WHERE timestamp IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
