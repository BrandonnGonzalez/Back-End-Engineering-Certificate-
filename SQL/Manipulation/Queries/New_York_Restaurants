--We have put together a table of restaurants called nomnom and we need your help to answer some questions. 
-- This is the current schema for the database: https://shorturl.at/Pkedn

-- step 1: Column names: name, neighborhood, cuisine, review, price, health


-- step 2: Selects distinct neighborhoods from table
--SELECT DISTINCT neighborhood FROM nomnom;

-- step 3: Selects distinct cuisine types from table
--SELECT DISTINCT cuisine FROM nomnom;

-- step 4: Selects all of the information from the table that results to the cuisine = 'Chinese'
--SELECT * FROM nomnom WHERE cuisine = 'Chinese';

-- step 5: Returns all restaurants with reviews > 4.
--SELECT * FROM nomnom WHERE review > 4;

-- step 6: Returns all restaurants that are italian and $$$
--SELECT * FROM nomnom WHERE cuisine ='Italian' AND price = '$$$';


-- step 7: Finds the restaurant that contains the word meatball using LIKE operator.
--SELECT * FROM nomnom WHERE name LIKE '%meatball%';

-- step 8: finds all of the restaurants that are either in the neighborhood of Midtown, Downtown, or Chinatown.
--SELECT * FROM nomnom WHERE neighborhood = 'Midtown' OR neighborhood = 'Downtown' OR neighborhood = 'Chinatown';

-- step 9: Finds all of the restaurants and their information that have a NULL health grade currently.
--SELECT * FROM nomnom WHERE health IS NULL;

-- step 10: This creates a top 10 restaurant ranking based on the reviews, by ordering by the rating in a descending order (highest to lowest), and limiting it to 10 rows.

--SELECT * FROM NOMNOM ORDER BY review DESC LIMIT 10;

-- step 11: This creates a case statement (If-else) to change the rating system depending on certain conditions.
SELECT name, 
CASE
  WHEN review > 4.5 THEN 'Extraordinary'
  WHEN review > 4 THEN 'Excellent'
  WHEN review > 3 THEN 'Good'
  WHEN review > 2 THEN 'Fair'
  Else 'Poor'
END AS 'new ratings'
